# Naruto Intro Project

Welcome to the **Naruto Intro** project! This repository contains a starter Angular application intended to serve as an introduction to the world of Naruto (and Angular development).

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a clean, documented starting point for building a web application focused on Naruto content. Currently, it serves as "Phase 1" - a foundational setup ready for feature expansion.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
